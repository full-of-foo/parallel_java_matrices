Naive Result: action statistics: first = 65.053 ms, mean = 3.693 ms (CI deltas: -2.187 us, +2.440 us), sd = 205.963 us (CI deltas: -40.651 us, +60.079 us) WARNING: execution times have mild outliers, SD VALUES MAY BE INACCURATE
	----------
	--the action statistics were calculated from block statistics
	--each block measured 512 task executions
	--the user says that task internally performs m = 1 actions
	--then the number of actions per block measurement is a = 512
	--block statistics: mean = 1.891 s (CI deltas: -1.120 ms, +1.249 ms), sd = 4.660 ms (CI deltas: -919.827 us, +1.359 ms)
	--the forumla used to convert block statistics to action statistics (mean scales as 1/a, sd scales as 1/sqrt(a)) assumes that the action execution times are iid
	----------
	--each confidence interval (CI) is reported as either +- deltas from the point estimate, or as a closed interval ([x, y])
	--each confidence interval has confidence level = 0.95
	----------
	--EXECUTION TIMES APPEAR TO HAVE OUTLIERS
	--this was determined using the boxplot algorithm with median = 1.891 s, interquantileRange = 4.944 ms
	--1 are mild (on the low side): #0 = 1.880 s
	--3 are mild (on the high side): #57 = 1.902 s, #58 = 1.903 s, #59 = 1.906 s

Better Result: action statistics: first = 1.857 ms, mean = 626.460 us (CI deltas: -5.847 us, +6.700 us), sd = 1.116 ms (CI deltas: -153.401 us, +197.990 us) WARNING: execution times may have serial correlation, SD VALUES MAY BE INACCURATE
	----------
	--the action statistics were calculated from block statistics
	--each block measured 2048 task executions
	--the user says that task internally performs m = 1 actions
	--then the number of actions per block measurement is a = 2048
	--block statistics: mean = 1.283 s (CI deltas: -11.975 ms, +13.721 ms), sd = 50.524 ms (CI deltas: -6.942 ms, +8.960 ms)
	--the forumla used to convert block statistics to action statistics (mean scales as 1/a, sd scales as 1/sqrt(a)) assumes that the action execution times are iid
	----------
	--each confidence interval (CI) is reported as either +- deltas from the point estimate, or as a closed interval ([x, y])
	--each confidence interval has confidence level = 0.95
	----------
	--EXECUTION TIMES HAVE SERIAL CORRELATION
	--1 of the 15 autocorrelation function coefficients (r[k]) that were computed are expected to fall outside their 95% CI
	--but found these 5: r[1] is 5.976600859023351 sigma above its mean, r[2] is 3.5227215514482286 sigma above its mean, r[3] is 2.981542118833413 sigma above its mean, r[4] is 2.670999761440013 sigma above its mean, r[5] is 2.190482947530541 sigma above its mean
	--the 95% CI for the r[k] was calculated as mean +- 1.96 sigma (i.e. a Gaussian distribution was assumed)
	----------
	--sd results have unknown validity (the environmental noise test was skipped)
	----------
	--action sd values ALMOST CERTAINLY GROSSLY INFLATED by outliers
	--they cause at least 92.25323398026657% of the measured VARIANCE according to a equi-valued outlier model
	--model quantities: a = 2048.0, muB = 1.2829903164833338, sigmaB = 0.050523917952689096, muA = 6.264601154703779E-4, sigmaA = 0.0011164314061393502, tMin = 0.0, muGMin = 3.132300577351889E-4, sigmaG = 7.830751443379723E-5, cMax1 = 491, cMax2 = 150, cMax = 150, cOutMin = 150, varOutMin = 0.0023549172009040176, muG(cOutMin) = 3.1332105630832414E-4, U(cOutMin) = 0.004588713010734231
