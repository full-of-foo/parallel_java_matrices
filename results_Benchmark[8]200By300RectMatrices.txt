	----------
	--the action statistics were calculated from block statistics
	--each block measured 256 task executions
	--the user says that task internally performs m = 1 actions
	--then the number of actions per block measurement is a = 256
	--block statistics: mean = 1.392 s (CI deltas: -495.312 us, +496.668 us), sd = 1.963 ms (CI deltas: -310.804 us, +501.309 us)
	--the forumla used to convert block statistics to action statistics (mean scales as 1/a, sd scales as 1/sqrt(a)) assumes that the action execution times are iid
	----------
	--each confidence interval (CI) is reported as either +- deltas from the point estimate, or as a closed interval ([x, y])
	--each confidence interval has confidence level = 0.95
	----------
	--EXECUTION TIMES APPEAR TO HAVE OUTLIERS
	--this was determined using the boxplot algorithm with median = 1.392 s, interquantileRange = 2.483 ms
	--1 are mild (on the low side): #0 = 1.386 s
	----------
	--sd results have unknown validity (the environmental noise test was skipped)

Better Result: action statistics: first = 1.937 ms, mean = 652.295 us (CI deltas: -4.149 us, +4.628 us), sd = 785.233 us (CI deltas: -111.020 us, +149.632 us) WARNING: execution times may have serial correlation, SD VALUES MAY BE INACCURATE
	----------
	--the action statistics were calculated from block statistics
	--each block measured 2048 task executions
	--the user says that task internally performs m = 1 actions
	--then the number of actions per block measurement is a = 2048
	--block statistics: mean = 1.336 s (CI deltas: -8.498 ms, +9.478 ms), sd = 35.536 ms (CI deltas: -5.024 ms, +6.772 ms)
	--the forumla used to convert block statistics to action statistics (mean scales as 1/a, sd scales as 1/sqrt(a)) assumes that the action execution times are iid
	----------
	--each confidence interval (CI) is reported as either +- deltas from the point estimate, or as a closed interval ([x, y])
	--each confidence interval has confidence level = 0.95
	----------
	--EXECUTION TIMES HAVE SERIAL CORRELATION
	--1 of the 15 autocorrelation function coefficients (r[k]) that were computed are expected to fall outside their 95% CI
	--but found these 5: r[1] is 5.906268660285003 sigma above its mean, r[2] is 3.509553500671518 sigma above its mean, r[3] is 2.4838792230522753 sigma above its mean, r[4] is 2.518995550518177 sigma above its mean, r[5] is 2.1403112522716676 sigma above its mean
	--the 95% CI for the r[k] was calculated as mean +- 1.96 sigma (i.e. a Gaussian distribution was assumed)
	----------
	--sd results have unknown validity (the environmental noise test was skipped)
	----------
	--action sd values ALMOST CERTAINLY GROSSLY INFLATED by outliers
	--they cause at least 84.42229388772662% of the measured VARIANCE according to a equi-valued outlier model
