Better Result: action statistics: first = 274.077 ms, mean = 1.180 ms (CI deltas: -2.031 us, +3.259 us), sd = 319.437 us (CI deltas: -95.967 us, +210.726 us) WARNING: EXECUTION TIMES HAVE EXTREME OUTLIERS, SD VALUES MAY BE INACCURATE
	----------
	--the action statistics were calculated from block statistics
	--each block measured 1024 task executions
	--the user says that task internally performs m = 1 actions
	--then the number of actions per block measurement is a = 1024
	--block statistics: mean = 1.208 s (CI deltas: -2.079 ms, +3.337 ms), sd = 10.222 ms (CI deltas: -3.071 ms, +6.743 ms)
	--the forumla used to convert block statistics to action statistics (mean scales as 1/a, sd scales as 1/sqrt(a)) assumes that the action execution times are iid
	----------
	--each confidence interval (CI) is reported as either +- deltas from the point estimate, or as a closed interval ([x, y])
	--each confidence interval has confidence level = 0.95
	----------
	--EXECUTION TIMES APPEAR TO HAVE OUTLIERS
	--this was determined using the boxplot algorithm with median = 1.205 s, interquantileRange = 11.173 ms
	--1 are EXTREME (on the high side): #59 = 1.259 s
	--1 are mild (on the high side): #58 = 1.237 s
	----------
	--sd results have unknown validity (the environmental noise test was skipped)
	----------
	--action sd values likely INFLATED by outliers
	--they cause at least 20.8552883967694% of the measured VARIANCE according to a equi-valued outlier model
	--model quantities: a = 1024.0, muB = 1.2079959482333333, sigmaB = 0.01022197685852686, muA = 0.0011796835431966146, sigmaA = 3.1943677682896436E-4, tMin = 0.0, muGMin = 5.898417715983073E-4, sigmaG = 1.4746044289957682E-4, cMax1 = 954, cMax2 = 800, cMax = 800, cOutMin = 800, varOutMin = 2.179144285476975E-5, muG(cOutMin) = 5.902430487134925E-4, U(cOutMin) = 0.0013447268816518887
